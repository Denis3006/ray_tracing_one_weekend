# Basic ray tracer
The project is an improved implementation of the Peter Shirley book [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://github.com/petershirley/raytracinginoneweekend).

## Implemented improvements

* Output as commonly used formats (JPG, PNG) using [stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb) library
* Multi-threaded rendering using std::async
